As I got plenty familiar with NYC visiting friends there, I was able to identify one particularly interesting issue.
1. The issue
To notify the authorities of non-emergency problems, the number 311 is used. One of the possible issues is housing, and it is addressed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The number of requests and issues rises every year, hence a system was put in place to sort and filter the complaints using a number of questions:
Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?
Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?
Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?
Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1? Your organization has assigned you as the lead data scientist to provide the answers to these questions. You need to work on getting answers to them in this Capstone Project by following the standard approach of data science and machine learning.
Etc.
